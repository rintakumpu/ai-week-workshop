This is done by building a machine learning model called neural network. We’ll be using [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digits to train and test our machine learning model. The end result will recognize numbers with a good accuracy.\n",

Nielsen** but also touches further chapters of that book. *Backpropagation* is not discussed in this tutorial as it's covered by the *[Chapter 2](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html)* of the book, but feel free to ask coaches about it and check how the backpropagation code works.\n",

    "3. Run \"plain\" neural network code in Python.\n",
    "4. Understand how to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model, neural networks included.\n",
    "5. Try out different network parameters to see the effect on its performance.\n",
